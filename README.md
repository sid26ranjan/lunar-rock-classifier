# lunar-rock-classifier

the dataset contains images of rock of two types either ‘Large Rock’ or ‘Small Rock’ it has 5999 ‘Small Rock’ images & 5999
‘Large Rock’ images.we have to build a deep learning model to predict the class of the images in the test datset .

the test dataset contains 7534 images of 2 sizes of lunar rocks.the deep learning model should work such that given an image,
the model will predict the probability of every rock class.

in this deep learning i have used convolution neural network with image augmentation which gave me a good accuracy on the
training set as well as a good score on the test dataset.
